# IR_without_solar_interference
Code to use the IR arduino sensor without solar interference

I made this code so that i could use a IR outdoors, I needed for a low budget product..

Anyway, this code will provide an adaptative IR for any kind of environment with or without sun, you can use the variation of the variable 'x' when there is sun,
or the variable 'y' when there is no sun :), hope its helpful...
